Trello Board Link: https://trello.com/invite/b/DXqduADz/9aab756b493e6334b746fb2c0cba5f17/quick-definitions-web-extension

Main branch is locked, requiring approval from the other two team memebers. Project was also made public, everyone is ok without annonymity.

## Part 2 - Scrum pre-game planning, update and expand the project proposal
### A short description of your project
  1. While using a Web Browser, when the user encounters a word, in which they are not sure what it means, the word can be highlighted, and then either by right-clicking with the mouse, or by key shortcut, will reveal the definition of the word. The definition will be displayed as a small pop-up on the screen, rather than redirecting to dictionary.com.

### Installation instructions
  1. Go to the library of Chrome extensions, found in the chrome web store, then continue to the extensions link.

### How to build instructions
  1. They have to install it, and then the extension just runs.

### Project proposal updated to include new ideas, insights or feedbacks from all team members
  1. Link to the project proposal: https://github.com/CIS3296SoftwareDesignF21/feedback-on-proposals-section-005-m-w-3-30pm/issues/5

### Vision statement
  1. To have a browser extension that works quickly, efficiently, and effectively to display the definition of a highlighted word somewhere on the web browser's window. This will be as streamlined as possible to eliminate user error to the best of our abilities.

### Three personas
  1. Janet is a college student, studying English composition at Harvard University. She is a hard worker, but sometimes she forgets the meaning of certain words. For the duration of her college career, she needs to write a lot of essays. A big part of her essays is to read highlights from certain well-known authors. Many of these authors use big fancy words, and Janet has a hard time keeping up with it. Dictionary.com is a major resource of her's, however it can be time consuming to have too many tabs open at one time. This extension will significantly improve Janet's quality of life at Harvard. As she is not a computer science major, it is important that this browser extension is as simple to use as possible for her. Using the browser console is not really an option for her.

  2. Greg is an SAT tutor in Palm Spring, California. While teaching high-schoolers good essay writing skills, it is important that he stay up to date on definitions of words that he comes across while grading test essays. He primarily uses his computer to grade these essays over Canvas. While grading, he may sometimes have dozens of tabs open at a time. His students often use words that he is unfamiliar with, and it would be nice if he could quickly get a definition without having to navigate around so much. This can save him time, and energy.

  3. Jose doesn't need it because he could care less, however he thinks it is super cool. He is downloading it for the fun of it. He works as a mechanic for a Honda dealership in Miami, Florida. Part of his job is filling out paperwork on the computer in the back, and while he is there, he reads from instruction manuals online. He is interested in this as a compliment to his job, though he doesn't really need it. He does it for fun rather than function, as he could just as easily open up dictionary.com.
