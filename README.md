Trello Board Link: https://trello.com/invite/b/DXqduADz/9aab756b493e6334b746fb2c0cba5f17/quick-definitions-web-extension

Main branch is locked, requiring approval from the other two team memebers. Project was also made public, everyone is ok without annonymity.

## Part 2 - Scrum pre-game planning, update and expand the project proposal
### A short description of your project
  While using a Web Browser, when the user encounters a word, in which they are not sure what it means, the word can be highlighted, and then either by right-clicking with the mouse, or by key shortcut, will reveal the definition of the word. The definition will be displayed as a small pop-up on the screen, rather than redirecting to dictionary.com.

### Installation instructions
  1. Download the latest release and extract it
  2. Open Google Chrome
  3. Navigate to Settings
  4. Select the Extensions tab
  5. Enable Developer Mode by using the toggle in the top right
  6. Click the button "Load Unpacked"
  7. Navigate to the directory where you extracted the release

### How to build instructions
  They have to install it, and then the extension just runs.

### Project proposal updated to include new ideas, insights or feedbacks from all team members
  Link to the project proposal: https://github.com/CIS3296SoftwareDesignF21/feedback-on-proposals-section-005-m-w-3-30pm/issues/5

### Vision statement
  For people who like to read and use dictionaries frequently, Quick Definitions is a Google Chrome extension that allows the user to see the definition of a highlighted word within a webpage. Unlike dictionary.com and other dictionary websites, Quick Definitions allows the user to find a definition without having to leave the current webpage or open a new tab.
