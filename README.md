Main branch is locked, requiring approval from the other two team memebers. Project was also made public, everyone is ok without annonymity.

## Part 2 - Scrum pre-game planning, update and expand the project proposal
### A short description of your project
  While using a Web Browser, when the user encounters a word, in which they are not sure what it means, the word can be highlighted, and then either by right-clicking with the mouse, or by key shortcut, will reveal the definition of the word. The definition will be displayed as a small pop-up on the screen, rather than redirecting to dictionary.com.

### Installation instructions

  2. Open Google Chrome

### Vision statement
  For people who like to read and use dictionaries frequently, Quick Definitions is a Google Chrome extension that allows the user to see the definition of a highlighted word within a webpage. Unlike dictionary.com and other dictionary websites, Quick Definitions allows the user to find a definition without having to leave the current webpage or open a new tab.

### Three personas
  1. Janet is a college student, studying English composition at Harvard University. She is a hard worker, but sometimes she forgets the meaning of certain words. For the duration of her college career, she needs to write a lot of essays. A big part of her essays is to read highlights from certain well-known authors. Many of these authors use big fancy words, and Janet has a hard time keeping up with it. Dictionary.com is a major resource of hers, however it can be time consuming to have too many tabs open at one time. This extension will significantly improve Janet's quality of life at Harvard. As she is not a computer science major, it is important that this browser extension is as simple to use as possible for her. Using the browser console is not really an option for her.

  2. Greg is an SAT tutor in Palm Spring, California. While teaching high-schoolers good essay writing skills, it is important that he stay up to date on definitions of words that he comes across while grading test essays. He primarily uses his computer to grade these essays over Canvas. While grading, he may sometimes have dozens of tabs open at a time. His students often use words that he is unfamiliar with, and it would be nice if he could quickly get a definition without having to navigate around so much. This can save him time, and energy.

  3. Jose doesn't need it because he could care less, however he thinks it is super cool. He is downloading it for the fun of it. He works as a mechanic for a Honda dealership in Miami, Florida. Part of his job is filling out paperwork on the computer in the back, and while he is there, he reads from instruction manuals online. He is interested in this as a compliment to his job, though he doesn't really need it. He does it for fun rather than function, as he could just as easily open up dictionary.com.
